WIP

An example single page site, such as for a small business, in this case the imaginary "Three Legged Stool" Restaurant

DEMO: https://hayleyashby7.github.io/Restaurant/

The site has a single page layout with static header section and a set of tabbed sections for About, Menu and Contact information. 

This was primarily a project to get practical experience implementing Webpack to manage assets and dynamically render a website. However I have gone beyond the intial requirements to stretch my current skills in front-end development. In particular, I challenged myself by loading the menu content dynamically with use of a JSON file and by implementing complex CSS aspects (collapsible menus, svg styling and animated navigation buttons).


Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack and NPM
